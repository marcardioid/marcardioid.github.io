Hiya!

My name is Marc. I'm a software engineer currently located in The Netherlands. Most places online I can be found as Pumpkinsoup or AWildPumpkin.

Sometimes programming makes me really sad because I want something to work SO much, but it doesn't. It is like forcefully smashing together two puzzle pieces as a child, until your friend angrily tells you "No! Those don't go together!" to which you respond "YES THEY DO!" with tears in your eyes. Then you realize that you're wrong, but you don't want to admit it so you say puzzles are dumb anyway and you go outside to play with bugs instead.

These are my infrequent ramblings.
