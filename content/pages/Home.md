I'm a senior data engineer from The Netherlands, currently working at [Nike](https://nike.com) on optimizing membership and personalization. Before that, I was a software engineer at [Avanade](https://avanade.com) where I focussed on scaling machine learning systems. 
I graduated in both computer science and investigative journalism - and love combining these two fields.

In my spare time I love writing about technology, automating my home with IoT, drawing pixel art and [developing my own video games](http://marcsleegers.com/splash/). I'm also quite the film geek.

My [PGP fingerprint](https://keybase.io/marcardioid) is C952 3D26 0BE7 69FA 0217 579C 977B E742 7927 7172.
