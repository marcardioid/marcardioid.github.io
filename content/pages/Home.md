I'm a software developer currently located in The Netherlands. Most places online I can be found as Pumpkinsoup or AWildPumpkin. (Hence the pumpkin.) What can I say? I love pumpkins.

This website is generated with [Pelican](http://getpelican.com), deployed with [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org) and [open sourced](https://github.com/marcardioid/marcsleegers.com) on GitHub. The site's theme is a heavily modified version of the beautiful [Pneumatic](https://github.com/iKevinY/pneumatic).

I'm currently a computer science intern at [Avanade](http://avanade.com), a joint venture of [Microsoft](http://microsoft.com) and [Accenture](http://accenture.com), where I'm researching Machine Learning. I also work as a freelance director and video editor. Favourite clients include Comedy Central's [Gamekings](http://gamekings.tv) and [Firstlook Festival](http://firstlookfestival.nl).

In my spare time I love [writing about technology](http://marcsleegers.com/blog/), automating my daily tasks with Python (3!), creating pixel art and [developing my own video games](http://marcsleegers.com/splash/). I'm also quite the film geek.

These are some of the projects I'm actively working on right now:

- [Watchdog](https://github.com/marcardioid/Watchdog) -- Python program that can watch a folder for media changes: automatically renames, tags and moves video files to your media server. Supports most scene naming conventions.
- [Guild Wars 2 API](https://github.com/marcardioid/GuildWars2API-Python) -- Python wrapper for the second version of the Guild Wars 2 API. Development focus is on supporting additional World versus World and Trading Post (commerce) functionality.
- [Random Dungeon Generator](https://marketplace.yoyogames.com/assets/1038/random-dungeon-generator) -- Commercial game development asset I'm selling on the GameMaker Marketplace. Build and play your own randomly generated Zeldalikes!

These are my [infrequent ramblings](http://marcsleegers.com/blog/).
