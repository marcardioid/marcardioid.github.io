I'm a senior data engineer at [Nike](https://nike.com) currently located in The Netherlands.

In my spare time I love writing about technology, automating my daily tasks, creating pixel art and [developing my own video games](http://marcsleegers.com/splash/). I'm also quite the film geek.

This static website is generated with [Pelican](http://getpelican.com), deployed with [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org) and [open sourced](https://github.com/marcardioid/marcsleegers.com) on GitHub. The site's theme is a heavily modified version of the beautiful [Pneumatic](https://github.com/iKevinY/pneumatic).

These are my [infrequent ramblings](http://marcsleegers.com/blog/).
