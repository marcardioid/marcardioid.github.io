I am the Lead Data Engineer at [Nike](https://nike.com){:target="_blank"}, where I ship scalable data-intensive applications as the Tech Lead for Membership & Personalization. I work with most of the Apache big data stack on a daily basis and I am well-versed in Python, for which I am [available as a tutor](mailto:mail@marcsleegers.com?subject=Python tutoring).

I am a published author, [a hobbyist game developer](https://marcsleegers.com/splash/){:target="_blank"} and quite the film geek. To wind down I love reading fantasy novels, automating my home and running long distances.

My [PGP fingerprint](https://keybase.io/marcardioid){:target="_blank"} is ```C952 3D26 0BE7 69FA 0217 579C 977B E742 7927 7172```.
