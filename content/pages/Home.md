I'm a senior data engineer from The Netherlands, currently working as tech lead at [Nike](https://nike.com){:target="_blank"} on optimizing membership and personalization. Before that, I was a software engineering consultant at [Avanade](https://avanade.com){:target="_blank"}. 
I graduated in both computer science and investigative journalism - and enjoy combining these two fields in my day-to-day.

In my spare time I love reading and writing about technology, automating my home and [developing my own video games](https://marcsleegers.com/splash/){:target="_blank"}. I'm also quite the film geek.

My [PGP fingerprint](https://keybase.io/marcardioid){:target="_blank"} is ```C952 3D26 0BE7 69FA 0217 579C 977B E742 7927 7172```.
