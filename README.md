# marcsleegers.com [![ðŸš€ Deploy to FTP](https://github.com/marcardioid/marcsleegers.com/actions/workflows/deploy_to_ftp.yml/badge.svg?branch=src)](https://github.com/marcardioid/marcsleegers.com/actions/workflows/deploy_to_ftp.yml)

This repository contains both the static files and the source files used to generate [marcsleegers.com]. 
It is generated with [Pelican], tested and deployed with Travis CI and open sourced right here.
The site's theme is a heavily modified version of the beautiful [Pneumatic].

The repository contains two distinct branches: the [`src`] branch contains the source files that Pelican uses to generate the static files which are automatically pushed to the [`master`] branch by Travis CI.
