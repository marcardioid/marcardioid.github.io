This repository contains both the static files and the source files used to generate [marcsleegers.com]. 
It is generated with [Pelican], tested and deployed with Travis CI and open sourced right here.
The site's theme is a heavily modified version of the beautiful [Pneumatic].

The repository contains two distinct branches: the [`src`] branch contains the source files that Pelican uses to generate the static files which are automatically pushed to the [`master`] branch by Travis CI.
