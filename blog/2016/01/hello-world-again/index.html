	<p>I&#8217;m not doing the whole introductory post thingy. Not because I think you won&#8217;t like me, but because life - like the software industry - is so <em>lively</em>.
What that even means? Let me tell&nbsp;you.</p>
<p>Everything around us is constantly evolving. In tech, there&#8217;s always a new language or a better way to do x just around the corner. In life, I could live in an entirely different place this time next year.
I&#8217;ve been reading a lot about the internet as an eternal archive lately and the outdated information you can find about certain people is <em>staggering</em>. Because of this, I decided against the introductory blog post&nbsp;trope.</p>
<p>Instead, I&#8217;d rather display my progression and my personality through my blog posts. Of course, the technologies I write about this year might not be relevant at all in a few winters. That doesn&#8217;t matter as much, though, because that content might still be useful to someone.
Unless it&#8217;s content about a problem I can&#8217;t solve and you stumble upon it via Google hoping to find a solution. Don&#8217;t you hate it when you find some post from 2004 describing the exact same problem you&#8217;re having right now and there&#8217;s <span class="caps">NO</span> comments?
It&#8217;s even worse when the post has been marked as solved by the poster. <em>What did you see, John?! <span class="caps">SHOW</span> <span class="caps">ME</span> <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">LIGHT</span>!</em></p>
<p>I digress. You still need to know who I am. No worries, I have a great solution for that! Remember the first page you saw when you went to this website? (Unless you&#8217;re a Googler. Hi!) I&#8217;m going to be using that as a living document.
This is going to be great for visitors - who will always get to know about me the way I am right then and there - and for me, because I don&#8217;t have to worry about outdated personal information in a blog&nbsp;post.</p>
<p>Now that we&#8217;ve been properly introduced - in a way - it&#8217;s time for me to tell you about this blog. Before I started studying Computer Science, I graduated as a journalist as I&#8217;ve always loved language.
Unfortunately, I&#8217;m not writing nearly enough to keep a proper style going. I also have some - hopefully - great ideas. So, after much consideration, I&#8217;ve finally decided to start up a blog again.
Right now<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>, this website is statically generated with <a href="https://getpelican.com">Pelican</a> and deployed with <a href="https://travis-ci.org">Travis <span class="caps">CI</span></a>. This is a very interesting method and one of the first things I&#8217;m going to be writing&nbsp;about.</p>
<p>Sounds exciting, right? <a href="/atom.xml">Stay tuned</a> for more of my infrequent&nbsp;ramblings.</p>

<p>Oops, I did it anyway. Time related content in the introductory blog post. Let&#8217;s see if this blog is still static in a year!&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
